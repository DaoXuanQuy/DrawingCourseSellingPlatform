# Drawing courses selling platform

Nowadays, the need for children to learn how to draw is very large, parents always want to have drawing courses to help their children improve their thinking and create a love for painting. However, in the market, the appearance of websites selling online courses is increasingly popular, including a few examples such as Udemy or Edumall, which are both websites selling online courses in a variety of fields, majors or subjects. But those platforms do not focus on developing a certain field for the community of art lovers. Besides, having to study at drwaing centers causes many time constraints. Most of a child's free time is focused on other school subjects such as Math, English, etc. Therefore, a platform that provides drawing courses will help parents and children access drawing lessons quickly, can learn comfortably without spending a lot of time and effort.
